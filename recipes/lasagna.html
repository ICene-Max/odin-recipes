    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy lasagna recipe bakes up cheesy and beautiful. It’s quick and simple to throw together and is a total crowd-pleaser.</p>
    <p>If you’re craving a plate of meaty, cheesy pasta comfort food, this lasagna absolutely delivers.</p> 
     
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Store-bought red pasta sauce:</strong>Using a store-bought sauce cuts a ton of prep work and time out of this recipe. I typically use Prego, but use whatever brand you prefer/is on sale.</li>
         <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong>This recipe is designed to be made with regular lasagna noodles, not oven-ready noodles.</li>
         <li><strong>Ground beef: </strong>I typically use 85% lean hamburger here, but any hamburger will work. If you like sausage in your lasagna, you can also swap in ground sausage (sweet, hot, or mild) instead. For a meatier lasagna, you can also double the beef.</li>
         <li><strong>An egg: </strong>Stirring an egg into the ricotta cheese makes it extra creamy and easier to spread when assembling your lasagna. But if you’re out of eggs or don’t like the idea, you can skip it.</li>
         <li><strong>Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese: </strong>Feel free to use bagged, pre-shredded cheese here. </li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the lasagna noodles until just al dente.</strong>Don’t overcook or they’ll become mushy in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the ground beef,</strong>add the pasta sauce and cook until sauce is hot and beef is cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix ricotta with egg,</strong>salt, and pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna.</strong>You’ll be doing three layers of noodles with sauce and cheese in between, alternating between laying the noodles horizontally and vertically. (This helps hold the layers together after baking.)</li>
        <li><strong>Bake and allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes</strong>before serving otherwise it will be so gooey the slices won’t hold together. Serve and enjoy!</li>
